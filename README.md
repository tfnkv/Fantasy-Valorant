I think React Native is a good thing to learn for cross-platform development

And maybe use Node.js or Django for backend

Django vs Node.js:  Django web framework is more dynamic and gives fast speed makes it more cost-effective than Node. js. The fact that Node. js absorbs more functioning time, even though it is easier to learn, makes it less cost-effective than Django.
Django is harder to learn vs learning Node.js
